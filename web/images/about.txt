Team Jerry began as five individuals getting assigned to the Great Leader Jerry's Team by the power of the Wheel. The Wheel was called upon as the Cohort of Azhya decided against using an old school draft as a method to create two teams. Upon our creation we immediately started on our mission of creating a clean, moderately simple, and inviting makeup ecommerce site for our clients to browse and purchase a variety of products from. We at Team Jerry hope that you find everything you need in a relaxing and easy shopping experience. 

Thank you for choosing us.
